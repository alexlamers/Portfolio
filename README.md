### [Chicago Social Vulnerability Index (SoVI)](https://github.com/alexlamers/chicago-sovi)
This project analyzes **social vulnerability in Cook County, Illinois**, combining **Census data and R** to better understand how environmental and climate hazards impact different communities.  

Key features:
- 📊 **Reproducible workflow** for processing and visualizing vulnerability data.  
- 🗺️ **High-resolution maps and visualizations** to highlight at-risk census tracts.  
- ⚡ **Actionable insights** for use in community planning, resilience programming, and equity-focused outreach.  

This project grew out of my interest in climate resilience and environmental justice and is designed to make complex data easier to use for both decision-makers and communities.
