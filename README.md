## Projects  

### [Chicago Social Vulnerability Index (SoVI)](https://github.com/alexlamers/chicago-sovi)  
Built a **social vulnerability index for Cook County, Illinois** using publicly available census data and R. The project demonstrates how vulnerability mapping can inform disaster preparedness and highlight disproportionate impacts on at-risk communities.  

**Key features:**  
- 📊 **Reproducible workflow** for data processing and visualization.  
- 🔄 **Modular design** adaptable to other counties or states.  
- 🗺️ **High-resolution maps and visuals** that integrate with climate and hazard datasets.  

This project reflects my broader focus on **climate resilience and environmental justice**, with the goal of making complex data **usable for both decision-makers and community members**.  

**Technical Stack:**  
- **Languages & Tools:** R
- **Libraries & Packages:** tidyverse, tidycensus, pysch, scales , tigris, sf, ggplot2
- **GIS & Visualization:** QGIS, ggplot2
